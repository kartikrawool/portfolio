## Description
- Developed an accurate and efficient method for identifying and segmenting brain tumors in medical images using
deep learning techniques, by implementing different models and optimizing them with various techniques.
- Achieved significant improvements in the segmentation accuracy, with a final model achieving an **IOU of 0.79 on
training and 0.75 on validation**, by combining the **UNet architecture with a ResNeXt50 backbone**, surpassing the
baseline UNet model with Adam optimizer.
