## Description
- Developed a web application using Streamlit which **detected humans** in a crowd, measured distance between them
and identified the **social distance violation** as module 1, **detected firearms** in video footage as module 2 and
**summarized video footage** to shorter duration clips with relevant frames as module 3.
- Utilized **Differencing and Summing Technique** to identify movement in the foreground of the video frame to
summarize the video.
- Trained YOLOv3 model on **3000 gun images** and achieved an accuracy of **55%.**
