## Description
- Preprocessed 40Hz **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)** data to match the 10Hz frequency of labels using nearest
label upsampling.
- Trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models on windowed 2-sec data,
achieving an impressive **85% F1 score** on testing data.
